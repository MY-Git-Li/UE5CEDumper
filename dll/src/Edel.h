// Walks GWorld → local PlayerController → Pawn (a self-contained copy of the
// teleport resolution chain — engine-stable field names, version-agnostic),
// enumerates the outgoing object pointers of {PC, Pawn, and their owned
// ActorComponents} via Aura::CollectOutgoingObjectPtrs, keeps those that pass
// the is-Actor structural super-chain test (excluding the player's own PC/pawn),
// scores each by name keyword + structural signal, and returns them sorted
// best-first. The top candidate (score > 0) is the auto-pick.
//
// Fast + bounded: NO full GObjects scan except the PlayerController
// instance-scan fallback inside the chain (only when the engine chain fails).
// Read-only — writes nothing to game memory. Honors Tot::Requested().
// maxCandidates caps the returned list (default 8, clamped to [1, 64]).
