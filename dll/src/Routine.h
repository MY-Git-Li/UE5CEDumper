// Routine — ルティーネ, 影の戦士の司書 (Shadow Warrior librarian)
// Periodic-worker scaffolding shared by every re-assert / hold module.
//
// Six modules (Solitar / Laufen / Hemmung / Solide / Dunste / Schlacht) run the same
// worker: mark the thread cancel-immune, sleep a period in short slices so a stop is
// honoured promptly, do one tick, repeat. That shape had been hand-copied six times,
// and audit #4 measured what hand-copying costs: the exception guard that build 2389
// added for a LIVE-reproduced 0xC0000409 reached 2 of the 7 thread procs, and the
// 25 ms sleep slice existed as 8 bare literals (B14 + R5).
//
// An exception escaping a thread entry is std::terminate, not a caught error. A worker
// tick reads live game state and allocates from it, so during the game's own teardown a
// read or a std::vector sizing can throw — which is precisely the crash that was
// observed. Every tick therefore runs inside RunTickGuarded, once, here.
//
// LOG_CAT: the macros below expand at the INCLUDE site, so include this header after
// the module's `#define LOG_CAT "..."`. The parenthetical that used to sit here —
// "(every module already defines it first)" — was FALSE and is why this went unnoticed:
// Fern.cpp defined it three lines too late, so this header's guard messages logged under
// "" (init-0.log) for the whole of the pipe server, and the only visible symptom was a
// C4005 macro-redefinition warning that read as cosmetic. Do not restate the claim; the
// compiler already enforces it, because getting it wrong warns. Each
// module's worker then logs under its own category, exactly as the hand-copied
// versions did.

// SafeThread — a std::thread whose destructor DETACHES instead of terminating.
// ============================================================
//
// `~std::thread()` on a still-joinable thread calls std::terminate() **directly** — no
// exception is thrown, so no `catch` anywhere can help. Same for move-assigning over a
// joinable thread. That is the real cause of the DQ7R fast-fails of 2026-08-04
// (0xC0000409 param[0]=7 = FATAL_APP_EXIT), which survived TWO generations of exception
// guards precisely because there was never an exception to catch:
//
//   * `UE5_Shutdown` is NOT called when the user closes a game — `DllMain(DETACH)` is a
//     deliberate no-op (joining a thread from DllMain deadlocks on the loader lock), and
//     there is no proxy graceful-exit hook. Verified: zero `UE5_Shutdown: Cleaning up`
//     lines in a whole session's log.
//   * So at process exit every feature worker is still joinable, its static destructor
//     runs, and the FIRST one to destruct kills the process.
//   * Which is exactly why it only ever reproduced with features switched ON.
//
// Fixing it by detaching from DllMain would have worked and would have been another
// hand-maintained LIST — the same shape that made B14 and B34 fail their first in-game
// check. This makes it a property of the TYPE instead: declare the thread as a
// SafeThread and the failure cannot occur, including in a module nobody has written yet.
//
// Detaching is the correct action at exit, not a cop-out: on process exit Windows has
// already terminated every other thread before DETACH runs, so there is nothing left to
// wait for — only a handle to release. Deliberate teardown still goes through each
// module's StopWorker(), which joins properly while the loader lock is free.

// terminating. A live DQ7R capture (2026-08-04, build 2622, WER param[0]=7 =
// FAST_FAIL_FATAL_APP_EXIT with the whole stack inside our own module) proved the
// enumeration itself was wrong: the DLL has ~15 places where a C++ exception means
// std::terminate, and the six feature workers are only some of them. The rest are Fern's
// accept / connection / watch / scan threads, Mimic's poller, Heiter's auto-start thread,
// and — the one that cannot be reached any other way — Stark's ProcessEvent hook, which
// runs on the GAME's own thread and is entered from game code that has no handler for us.
