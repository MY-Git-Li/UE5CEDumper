// ============================================================
// Sense — 賽恩瑟, ゼンゼ (Second-Exam proctor, "scythe" — harvest / collection)
// Diagnostics: self-health telemetry for the DLL + this process.
//
// Answers the question docs/multipipe-eval.md leaves open. That doc names
// DLL-side SERIAL-DISPATCH HEAD-OF-LINE BLOCKING as the root cause of UI lag and
// game-thread CPU starvation as the CE-mailbox risk — but nothing measured
// either, so "should Phase 1 (non-blocking dispatch) be built?" was decided
// blind. Sense records how long each pipe command actually occupies the
// dispatcher, which is the number that settles it.
//
// Two tiers, both cheap:
//   Tier 1 — our own health: per-command dispatch time (count / total / max /
//            last), sampled at Fern's single dispatch chokepoint.
//   Tier 2 — process facts from Win32: working set, private bytes, CPU%,
//            handle and thread counts. No UE dependency at all.
//
// Cost when nobody is looking: one mutex + a map lookup + a few adds per pipe
// command. Commands are microseconds at best, so this is noise. The Tier 2
// sample is on demand only (it walks a thread snapshot) and never runs unless a
// client asks.
