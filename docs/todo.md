## ▶ Next up (genuinely actionable now)

- **UE5.7+ packed FUObjectItem — live-verify + calibrate when a packed game appears** —
  Effort: **S** (mostly verify) · Risk: low (gated, last-resort only). Packed parsing shipped
  build 1108 but is **UNVERIFIED** (no `UE_ENABLE_FUOBJECT_ITEM_PACKING` game exists yet). When
  one does: attach, watch for the `*** UNVERIFIED ... PACKED ... ACTIVATED ***` WARN (or force via
  `set_packed_consts {force:true}`), then tune `align_bits`/`ptr_mask_bits`/`serial_off` against the
  echoed `GObjects[0..7]` samples until names resolve; confirm the object walk + a CE XML/CSX export
  are correct; then promote out of UNVERIFIED (drop the badge gate, pin the constants).
  Open sub-question: the packed **SerialNumber** offset (currently best-effort `0x0C`) is unpinned.
  *Parent: PackedItem.h + Aura packed mode + set_packed_consts shipped build 1108 (dev-log 2026-06-14).*

- **DLL cancellation — live-game verification** — Effort: **0** (verify only) · Risk:
  low. Confirm in-game that (a) disabling the script / closing the game while a long
  scan runs no longer hangs, (b) closing the UI mid-scan stops the DLL and a reopened
  UI reconnects promptly.
  *Parent: cooperative cancel + shutdown-abort + disconnect monitor shipped build
  936-937, PR #238 (dev-log 2026-06-06).*

## Multiple Values Group Scan — remaining phases (P1 shipped build 1276)

P1 (object-aware group scan, direct numeric leaves + one-level struct descent, exact-per-slot, mode toggle + master-detail UI) shipped builds 1276-1278 — new `Orden` SDR matcher. Follow-ups, in order:

- ~~**P1 in-game verification**~~ **DONE** — verified on SEED (UE4.27): single Value Search + Group Search both pass; Deep mode surfaces the buried `Tunes` block. *(dev-log 2026-06-18.)*

- ~~**P2 — prev-value per slot + offset-table**~~ **DONE (builds 1295-1302)** — per-slot scan type now on `Orden::SlotTarget` (`st`+`tolerance`+`targets2`, routed through `ComparePredicate`) + `RefineGroupCandidates`: First Scan takes Exact/Bigger/Smaller/**Between** per slot (Between = bounded-unknown entry, e.g. HP in [1,100]), Next Scan also takes the prev-value four (Changed/Unchanged/Increased/Decreased — compare each leaf vs its own previous round). Locked-offset table (`🔒 Class — Str@0x20, Def@0x24`) shows once all slots lock. **"Copy CE Script" / export was intentionally NOT built** — the owner exports the resolved chain from Live Walker (which already does it). **prev-value group refine in-game VERIFIED on SEED** (Unchanged/Unchanged/Increased ran clean); Between first-scan live-verify still nice-to-have. *(dev-log 2026-06-18.)*

- **P3 — numeric containers as blocks — LARGELY DONE (opt-in Deep, builds 1283-1285)**. The "Deep" toggle now treats each numeric `TArray/TSet` + each struct-array/map element as its own block via the recursive `WalkContainerLeaves`, matching the group WITHIN one array (finds the SEED `Tunes[N]` case). Single-value Deep forces the existing deep pass on all classes. *Remaining gaps* (Effort **S**): scalar-VALUED maps (`TMap<Name,int>` values) aren't emitted by `WalkContainerLeaves` (struct-valued maps are) — needs `cfe` to carry key/value leaf types (TODO already in the walker comment); and in-game verify of the Deep path on SEED. *Parent: dev-log 2026-06-18 deep entry.*

- **P4 — Attribute Component cross-object (opt-in)** — Effort: **L** · Risk: high (isolate). Follow `ObjectProperty` pointers whose target class name matches `AttributeSet`/`Component`, 1-2 hops, including the sub-object's numeric leaves in the actor's block (2-hop path candidate + pointer-aware refine). Reuse the read-ptr+validate pattern from `FindReferencesToUObject`. Default OFF (like Property Search "Deep"). *Parent: no forward object-pointer schema descent exists today.*

- **Deferred — Snapshot / SPC Query / Class Pivot group-match** — Effort: **M each** · Risk: low. The `Orden::MatchGroup` seam is source-agnostic; later feed `SnapshotCapturedObject.Fields` (hex→bytes) / SPC per-object sequences / a multi-field `DiscoveryInput` to run the SAME matcher over captured data ("N values co-occur in one snapshot object" / "N-field intersection query" / "pivot on co-varying tuples"). *Parent: P1 deliberately kept the matcher live-scan-agnostic for this.*

-----

## CE export drilldown — remaining gaps (Phase A/B/C shipped)

Phase A (CE XML/Field container-value expansion, build 1085), Phase B (CSX parity,
build 1098), Phase C (depth-from-current-view tests + CSX truncation note, build
1098) all shipped. Spec: [ce-export-drilldown-spec.md](ce-export-drilldown-spec.md).
Open follow-ups (low priority):

- **CSX struct-array element full re-walk** — Effort: **S** · Risk: low. CSX struct
  arrays still flatten the shallow Phase-F `StructFields` preview, so nested
  structs/maps *inside* an array element stay shallow. CE XML's
  `EmitStructArrayProperty` already re-walks each element via `resolvedStructs`
  (build 1076); mirror that in `ConvertArrayStructElementsToFields` (stamp
  `StructDataAddr` per element + route to `EmitStructPropertyFlattened`). The unified
  resolver already populates `resolvedStructs` for array struct elements — only the
  CSX emit path ignores it.
- **Nested-container truncation note** — Effort: **S** · Risk: low. The
  `⚠ Container element limit` note (CE XML + CSX) only scans top-level fields; a
  container clipped by `ArrayLimit` *inside* a drilled struct/pointer is unreported.
  Cheap: scan `resolvedStructs`/`resolvedInstances` values too. (Marked optional in
  the spec.)

-----

## Teleport — follow-ups (deferred / future research)

Teleport shipped (Wirbel, build 1027-1043). Works where the possessed pawn is
the visible character (SEED) and, via the deep-force, even on hard-cooked HD-2D
titles (Octopath — character moves). Open items, all per-game / research-grade:

- **Camera/POV doesn't follow on hard-cooked games (Octopath / SE HD-2D)** —
  Effort: **M-L** · Risk: med. **Read-only camera-POV display DONE + LIVE-VERIFIED
  builds 1110-1112** (Teleport tab → "Camera POV" → Get POV; `Wirbel::GetPov` +
  `teleport_get_pov` + a "Get camera POV" mailbox AA record). POV now **reads on
  all four tested titles** — getters on SEED / DQ III, and a fully-reflected
  `CameraCachePrivate.POV` raw fallback on TQ2 / Octopath (getters present but
  `ProcessEvent` returns nothing) — so you can *measure* the camera↔pawn delta.
  **That's the READ; the actual camera-FOLLOW-after-teleport fix below is still
  open** (POV read confirms the divergence but doesn't move the camera). Phase 2 ideas: FOV set/reset (`SetFOV`/`LockedFOV` is the only
  persistently-settable POV component); a "re-anchor camera" nudge after teleport
  (`SetViewTargetWithBlend(pawn,0)` + `SetGameCameraCutThisFrame()`). There is no
  universal Set POV — `UpdateCamera` overwrites it every tick. See
  [teleport-spec.md](teleport-spec.md) §15.
  The deep-force moves the pawn's root
  `ComponentToWorld`, but the camera tracks a separate child component
  (SpringArm / CameraComponent) or follow-camera actor whose world transform we
  never refresh — so the view stays put and can get **stuck unrecoverably**
  (no in-game event re-syncs the view-target chain; a save reload / area
  transition fixes it). Options, in order of cheapness: (1) invoke
  `APlayerController::SetViewTargetWithBlend(pawn, 0)` to re-anchor (likely also
  cooked out on these titles); (2) `APlayerCameraManager::SetGameCameraCutThisFrame()`
  for an instant cut; (3) deep-force the follow-camera component's
  `ComponentToWorld` too (need to *find* it — game-specific); (4) recompute
  child world transforms (manual `UpdateChildTransforms` — native, no
  reflection, hard). **Deferred**: no universal solution; a failed camera nudge
  risks making the stuck-camera worse. In-app disclaimer covers it.
- **TQ2 teleport — FIXED (build 1113); two minor caveats remain.** The old
  "separate visible actor" theory was **disproven** (build 1113 ViewTarget
  diagnostic): TQ2's pawn IS the camera view-target and owns the mesh + CMC. The
  failure was `K2_SetActorLocation` reporting success but not moving + a stale
  cached transform; fixed by always running `K2_SetWorldLocation` + deep-force in
  the CMC-freeze path. Marker teleport now works. Remaining: **(a) cursor teleport
  blocked** — TQ2 strips `GetMousePosition` (returns 0,0 / virtual cursor),
  `GetViewportSize`, and `KismetSystemLibrary`, so there's no generic way to read
  the cursor target (per-game RE only — low value, deferred); **(b) minor visual
  lag** — the mesh snaps over on the next move after a marker teleport (CMC network
  smoothing; a CMC smoothing-offset reset would fix it, Effort S, deferred). See
  [lessons-learned.md](lessons-learned.md) "TQ2 verdict".
- **Gamepad / mouse-extra-button hotkeys** — Effort: **M** · Risk: low.
  Marker hotkey capture is keyboard-only (`RegisterHotKey`). Mouse extra buttons
  + gamepad need low-level hooks / XInput polling ("record on all-released" per
  the user's spec). Deferred until requested.

-----

## Value Search — coverage + memory (build 923 plan)

Dependency order was **V3-A → V3-B → V1a → V3-C → V2**; **all shipped** (V3-C build 949:
DLL owns the set, UI is a server-side-filtered/sorted window; V2 build 954: ceiling
raised to 1M, sort/filter verified sub-second). Remaining open: **V1b** (container
prev-value refine) and **V1c live-verify**.

- **Deep Value-Search candidate → multi-level 🌍 drill** — ✅ **DONE build 1208.**
  Generalised `TryParseStructArrayInner`/`DrillToStructArrayInnerAsync` into
  `TryParseContainerPath` + `DrillDisplayPathAsync` (parse the full multi-`[N]`
  display path into ordered `(name,index)` segments; drill each as a container
  hop or direct-struct field; land on the final leaf). Wired into BOTH the VS/SPC
  `LocateInGWorldAsync` reach branch AND `NavigateToInstanceFieldAsync`
  (Open-in-Live-Walker — also fixes the offset-0 mis-select for deep candidates).
  Verified by a 4-agent audit (drill-sites + scan/capture correctness); the value
  was always FOUND — this was the land-ON-it polish. ⚠ in-game live-verify pending
  (multi-`[N]` 🌍 should land exactly on the SEED `...Tunes[N]` value).

- **Proper scalar-map value/key capture** — Effort: **M** · Risk: low.
  `WalkContainerLeaves` only recurses STRUCT map values; a `TMap<K,scalar>` value
  (and the scalar key of any map) is NOT captured. Build 1208 added a guard so the
  leaf-container branch no longer emits a *malformed* leaf for scalar-value maps
  (was: key-region addr + `"K → V"` arrow-label type, silently dropped by both
  consumers). To capture them properly, extend `ContainerCacheEntry` with
  `keyType`/`valueType` and emit the value leaf at `slotBase+valueOffset` (type
  `valueType`) + the key leaf at `slotBase` (type `keyType`). Audit #1/#3.
  *Affects Value Search + Snapshot; user's SEED case is `Map<Name,FStruct>` (struct
  value, recursed) so unaffected.*

- **Top-level `TSet<FStruct>` / `TMap<K,FStruct>` depth-1 inner leaves (Value Search)** —
  Effort: **S/M** · Risk: low. The static depth-1 collector (`collectStructArrayInner`)
  only covers `TArray<FStruct>`; the recursive `deepEmit` skips `depth<2` to avoid
  double-counting it. So the DIRECT fields of a struct element in a *top-level*
  Set/Map are scanned by neither path. (Nested ones — the SEED `MsTunes` case — are
  depth≥2 and ARE caught.) Fix: add a Set/Map analogue to `collectStructArrayInner`,
  or relax `deepEmit` to `depth>=1` for the Set/Map element side only. Audit #2.

- **SPC Strict-join `prop_offset` migration edge** — Effort: **S** · Risk: low.
  1-level struct-array element rows now store `prop_offset=0` (build 1205, was
  `nf.Offset`); a Strict-mode SPC query that mixes a pre-1205 and a post-1205
  snapshot keys the same logical field differently. Either zero `prop_offset` for
  array-element rows in the Strict key, or bump the schema to force recapture.
  Audit #4. *Cosmetic unless mixing snapshots across the 1205 boundary.*

- **Interesting Props: optional "Locate in GWorld" 🌍** — Effort: **S** · Risk: low.
  The panel intentionally has no 🌍 (its rows are class/property DEFINITIONS, not
  instances — no single address to locate; the existing **Live** button opens a
  live instance). If wanted, add a 🌍 that resolves an instance of the row's class
  then calls `LocateInGWorldAsync(addr, 0, null, stopAtParent:true)` — exactly the
  Instance Finder selected-instance flow. *User noted the button's absence on SEED,
  2026-06-16; offered as opt-in.*

- **V1b — container prev-value refine (stable key)** — Effort: **M** · Risk: **high**.
  `Candidate.addr` stores a raw element address; TArray realloc already makes it stale,
  and TSparseArray is worse — freed slots get reused, so `c.addr` on refine may point at
  a different logical entry → Changed/Unchanged semantics silently lie. Store
  `container addr + slot index` as a stable key and re-walk the sparse array on refine
  (same idea as snapshot's `SelectArrayInnerKey`). **Do only if refine-on-container is
  actually requested.**
  *Parent: V1a TSet/TMap key|value scan shipped First-Scan-only, build 927 (dev-log
  2026-06-06).*

## Experimental: Snapshot / SPC / Class Pivot

Gated behind the System-tab opt-in (`IExperimentalGate`). Design of record:
[experimental-snapshot-spc-pivot.md](experimental-snapshot-spc-pivot.md). Phases
0/A/B/C (C1+C3-lite+C4+C5+C6) + N1 noise picker all shipped; the engine rework
(in-memory hash-joins), heavy-query cancellation, persisted pivot index, and
Windows-only AOT backend all shipped (dev-log builds 805–923).

- **C2 — find-by-value locator + pivot handoff** — Effort: **M** · Risk: **med**.
  Closes the loop: locate which class/field holds a known value, then hand off into
  Class Pivot.
  *Parent: Pivot Phase C (C1/C3-lite/C4/C5/C6) shipped builds 830-877 (dev-log).*

- **A3c — CE .CT freeze-export from a diff/SPC/pivot hit** — Effort: **M** · Risk: low.
  Copy Address already covers the manual path; this is the full automated freeze export.
  *Parent: A3 diff engine + Copy Address shipped build 817.*

- **Heavier C3 scorer** — Effort: **M** · Risk: med. Jaccard stability + greedy compound
  key + class shortlist / volatility ranking (the "29i-3" scorer).
  *Parent: C3-lite key scorer shipped build 830.*

- **N1 v2 — per-`(class, prop)` deny granularity** — Effort: **M** · Risk: low. v1 is
  by-class; some classes (`ACharacter`, `APawn`) carry both gameplay fields (`Health`)
  and noise (`Velocity`, `LastRenderTime`). v2 would chevron-expand each Top-N row to its
  Top-K noisiest props. **Defer until v1 proves the bulk case is solved.**
  *Parent: N1 per-tab class denylist shipped builds 908-910 (dev-log 2026-06-05).*

- *(optional)* **`discrete`-style gzip blob storage** — Effort: M · Risk: low. Only if
  snapshot DB size becomes a real concern.

-----

## Bytecode cross-reference: property ↔ function — deferred follow-ups

Path 1 (BP Kismet bytecode) core + v2a, and Path 2 (native via Zydis/Denken) forward
direction, both shipped (dev-log builds 838-872).

- **Path 1 v2b — CFG-precise attribution** — Effort: **L** · Risk: **med-high**. v2a's
  "nearest entry offset" mis-attributes a sub-graph reached from multiple events via
  jumps; the `EX_Let*` write detector misses wrapped LHS (`Other.Field` / `Struct.Member`
  / `Arr[i] = x`). A real variable-length decoder (follow `EX_Jump` / `EX_JumpIfNot` /
  `EX_ComputedJump`, parse the LHS expression tree) fixes both. Reference:
  `vendor/RE-UE4SS/.../KismetDebugger.cpp` (`render_expr`) + `EExprToken`. **Only when a
  real mis-attribution motivates the cost.**
  *Parent: Path 1 + v2a shipped builds 838-861.*

- **Path 2 follow-ups** — (a) **reverse direction** (property → native funcs; needs
  disassembling every native function per query — expensive); (b) **SIB-indexed**
  `[reg+idx*scale+disp]` accesses (currently skipped); (c) **CFG-aware branch following**
  (only fall-through + direct call/tail-jmp followed today); (d) live tuning of the
  `this`-tracking + Func-offset detector across more games.
  *Parent: Path 2 native UFunction analysis shipped builds 862-872.*

-----

## Call-UE-function / invoke

- **#2 Live ProcessEvent Call Profiler** — Effort: **M-L** · Risk: **med** (PE is hot
  path). Rank UFunctions by **observed behaviour** instead of name heuristics. `Stark`
  already ticks `s_hookFireCount` — extend with a per-UFunction atomic counter + a
  "Recording" toggle + 3 pipe cmds (`start/stop/get_pe_profile`) + a "Live Funcs" tab.
  Workflow: Start → perform action ("open inventory") → Stop → see what fired. Keep
  PE hot-path overhead < 100ns/call (lockless atomic; benchmark before shipping).
  Biggest blast radius of the picks.

- **#7 View Snap Hotkey (Property → snap-to-step)** — Effort: **S-M** · Risk: **low**.
  Bind a CE hotkey that snaps a Float/Double property to the next N° step (rotation
  snap) — generalises to MoveSpeed multipliers, zoom levels, time-dilation cycling.
  New row action + `SnapHotkeyDialog` + `scripts/ue5_snap_helper.lua` +
  `SnapHotkeyScriptGenerator.cs`. **95% mirrors the build-719 freeze Route B.**

- **Add-on: AA(Baked) "Auto-tick every N ms"** — Effort: **S** · Risk: low. Wrap the
  generated `invokeUFunction` call in a `createTimer(N, callback)` block ([DISABLE] tears
  it down); same per-script keyed handle table as FreezeScript. Lands as a 1-day add-on
  after #7 (both touch the script generator + dialog).

- **#5 v2 — ObjectProperty return resolution + recursive struct expansion** —
  Effort: **S + S**. (a) Resolve ObjectProperty/ClassProperty returns to "Name (Class)"
  via a DLL pipe round-trip (`resolve_object_name(addr)` or extend the invoke response).
  (b) Recursively expand nested structs (`FHitResult.Location` → its own FVector rows).
  *Parent: #5 structured-return DataGrid shipped build 775, PR #211.*

- **#0c FTransform Translation offset** — Effort: **S** · Risk: low. `VectorStructNames
  (FTransform)` returns empty → zero hits. Needs per-version Translation offset detection
  (UE4 / UE5-non-LWC at +16, UE5 LWC at +32).
  *Parent: Value Search Phase 2 vectors shipped build 757, PR #208.*

- **FString / FText / TArray input in baked AA Script** — Effort: **M** · Risk: **med**.
  Functions like `KismetSystemLibrary::PrintString` are observable side-effect verify
  targets but unreachable — the helper's `writeBakedParams` only handles scalar inputs.
  Needs CE-side buffer alloc + FString header write (ptr/count/max) + keep-alive + free
  in the cleanup timer. Same pattern for FText + TArray-of-scalars. (Open since the build
  643-644 ES2 live test.)

- **LiveWalker batch generator (v2 of the CT batch)** — Effort: **S-M**. Heterogeneous
  rows (functions + fields + struct sub-fields + array elements) + drilldown state — needs
  its own UX pass.
  *Parent: #3 multi-row → one .CT batch (Interesting Funcs/Props) shipped build 760.*

- **Dual-connection pipe (eliminate head-of-line blocking)** — Effort: **M** · Risk:
  **high** (in-process DLL concurrency). **POSTPONED 2026-06-01.** Full design:
  [multi-connection-pipe-proposal.md](multi-connection-pipe-proposal.md). Engine-side
  concurrency is already safe (builds 792/793 + SessionManager); residual risk is Fern's
  accept/shutdown rewrite. Benefit is moderate (parallel scans already shrank the blocking
  window) — revisit only if "UI freezes during a big scan" becomes a real pain.

- **KismetMathLibrary stub-pattern UX hint** — Effort: **S** · Risk: low. On UE 5.5+
  cooked Shipping, `KismetMathLibrary::Add_IntInt` etc. consistently return 0 (cooker
  strips the `execXxx` thunk). Add a "Recommended verification targets" footer hint when
  the selected class is `KismetMathLibrary` / `KismetSystemLibrary`, and update
  lessons-learned / test-games. (Not a feature to enable calling them — a UX redirect.)

- **Mimic: zero the ReturnValue slot before invoke** — Effort: **S** · Risk: low. ES2
  showed Before/After dumps identical (stale `0x49`) so we can't tell "wrote 73" from
  "didn't touch ReturnValue". Overwrite the slot with a sentinel / zero before calling PE
  so the After dump is unambiguous. ~2-line patch in `Mimic.cpp` (both fast path + game-
  thread dispatch).

- **CE Lua AA Script activation hang — UX hardening** — Effort: **M** (mitigation) ·
  Risk: low. AA Script sometimes never reaches the mailbox (CE Lua froze or hid an error).
  Mitigations: re-arm helper-injected check on UI Connect; mailbox heartbeat `print()`
  before the write; early-exit `if not g_invokeMailbox then showMessage(...) end` in the
  helper. (UX hardening, not a correctness bug — we can't distinguish AA-error from CE
  freeze from the DLL side.)

-----

## Property scoring / discovery

- **Class Family Browser (Proposal C)** — Effort: **L** · Risk: **med**. New "Class
  Family" tab bucketing game classes by inferred role (Character / Pawn / Inventory /
  Stats / Save / Components / DataAssets / DataTables / GameMode) — the "I have no idea
  where to start in a new game" entry point. **NOT a jump-in-and-code task** — the
  classification heuristic + UI design needs its own planning round (cluster the dump
  corpus's BPGCs by property-name similarity first).

- **Proposal B — per-row "similar BP-added properties"** — Effort: **M** · Risk: low.
  **DEFERRED indefinitely.** When the user lands on `bCanBeDamaged @ AActor`, surface a
  side-panel of fuzzy-matched game-specific bools (`bIsImmortal @ BP_PlayerCharacter_C`).
  B' (the broad-sweep Interesting Properties) already covers the workflow — revisit only
  if a real user reports the specific gap B fills.

- **Runtime `keywords.json` override** — Effort: **M** · Risk: **med**. Let users tune
  the scoring tables without recompiling (source-gen JSON for AOT; hardcoded fallback;
  additive vs replace mode; "Export current tables to JSON" seed button). **Only if a
  user actually asks.**

- **More-genre dump coverage (calibration)** — Effort: **S** (mostly user-side). The
  corpus is heavy on JRPG/sim/ARPG/FPS/racing/sandbox; missing MMO/fighting/horror/RTS/
  sports-sim. Dump 3-5 games per genre → re-run `scripts/analysis/analyze_dumps.py` → PR
  keyword adds with evidence attached.

-----

## Carryover capability gaps

Pick up when the active plan finishes or when blocked.

- **MulticastSparseDelegateProperty UE 4.23-4.27** — Effort: **L** · Risk: **med**.
  Closes the last delegate-flavour gap (UE5 landed in PR #194). UE4 needs a separate AOB
  + walker branch: outer key is `FObjectKey {FWeakObjectPtr; int32 SerialNumber}` (16B)
  not raw `UObjectBase*`, outer stride ~0x60 → ~0x68, key match reconstructs `FObjectKey`
  from `(owner, GetSerialNumber(InternalIndex))`. Walker currently returns
  `supported=false` for UE < 5.0.

- **Find Refs v4 — TMap / TSet weak-like inner sides** — Effort: **M** · Risk: **low**.
  Currently Object/Class only; weak/soft pointer collections (`TMap<UObject*,
  FWeakObjectPtr>` etc.) silently miss target hits. Reuse the v3 weak-resolve helper
  inside the existing TMap/TSet walkers in `Aura::FindReferencesToUObject`.

- **FieldPathProperty drill-down + Find Refs** — Effort: **M** · Risk: **low**. Last
  remaining no-handler property type. Rare in shipping games (only Editor-derived
  classes) — genuinely low priority.

- **GWorld coverage** — Effort: **S each** · Risk: low. Two remaining titles:
  - **Star Wars Jedi: Survivor** (UE 4.27?) — untested; needs an AOB sweep + result triage.
  - **Satisfactory** (UE 5.3, modular DLL build) — (1) proxy DLL injection fails (loader
    bypasses normal proxy hooking; workaround = CE manual injection); (2) GWorld pattern
    likely lives in `CoreUObject-Win64-Shipping.dll` — adapt `Genau::FindAll` to scan
    multiple modules when the primary scan fails.

- **`kPublishers[]` table additions** — Effort: **S each** · Risk: **high** (if added
  casually — wrong publisher bias overrides correct detection). Only add a publisher with
  ≥3 misdetected titles AND a clear pattern. Wait for real misdetection reports.

-----

## Pending live-game verification (verify only — no code)

Shipped + unit-tests-pass but unproven on real games:

- **Value Search 1M cap (V2)** (build 954). Set Max near 1,000,000 on a broadly-matching
  value; confirm First Scan completes (or hits the 15 s deadline cleanly), the grid pages
  via Load More, and the server-side keyword filter + sort picker stay responsive at that
  size (scale bench says ~0.6–0.7 s per filter/sort change over 1M; verify it feels OK
  in-app, where it's debounced).
- **Value Search `TOptional<T>` scan (V1c)** (build 942). Scan a known value held in a
  `TOptional<int/float/FString>` UPROPERTY → confirm the row appears under the optional's
  field name and a Next Scan prunes; confirm an **unset** optional doesn't surface on a
  scan for `0` (the `bIsSet` gate). Layout helper is unit-tested; the field walk needs a
  live game with optional UPROPERTYs.
- **Property freeze (Route B)** on a respawning-NPC game (build 719). Watch: tick FPS
  impact (50ms × N instances), rescan cadence at respawn, vtable-liveness guard on level
  transition, AOBMaker gating UX, multi-script coexistence. First candidate: Geri (UE
  4.27).
- **Build-648 ProcessEvent fix** re-verify on ES2 (UE 5.5) + Geri (UE 4.27): look for
  `GameThreadDispatch: validation OK — hook fired N times`; previously-`-5`-timing-out
  instance invokes should now succeed. Lower-priority extras: a UE 4.18-4.24 game (smaller
  vtable / lower slot) + a heavily-modified publisher fork.
- **Static-native PE fast path** (build 636) latency vs game-thread dispatch on an active
  session; confirm stateful UFunctions still route through dispatch (don't fall into the
  fast path by accident).
- **FPROPERTY_FLAGS offset fix** (build 642): sweep the 12+ tested games' Class Structure
  Return columns + confirm baked PARAMS no longer include ReturnValue as an input.
- **Verify Return Value diagnostic** (build 637/644): pointer-return shows `0x` prefix;
  FString-return shows the "see After: dump above" hint.
- **`walk_functions_batch` follow-up** — Effort: **S**. Sister to `walk_class_batch`;
  DumpAll still does `WalkFunctions` single-call per class. Same byte-equivalence safety
  net. **Skip unless profiling shows it as the new bottleneck.**

## Speculative — pick if the active plan finishes ahead of schedule

Not yet committed to:

- **Invoke history / favorites panel** — auto-record (target, args, result) per
  invocation; one-click re-fire.
- **Dry-run-first invoke** — for never-called functions, invoke with zero/sentinel params
  first to detect a crash before committing real args.
- **CE table builder** — bundle selected pointer entries + AA scripts into a single `.ct`,
  auto-grouped by category (broader than the build-760 Interesting Funcs/Props batch).
- **Global hotkey binding** for shortlisted functions ("give 1000 gold" on Ctrl+G).
- **Property freeze — Route A (docs only)** — reuse CE XML/CSX export to land a pointer
  chain, user manually ticks Freeze in CE. Works today, no code; tradeoff is the chain
  binds to one resolved instance (breaks on respawn). Keep for one-shot static-singleton
  freezes so users don't have to wait for Route B.
