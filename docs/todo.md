## ▶ Next up (genuinely actionable now)

- **dxgi proxy early-load fragility — harden (thin-shim + renamed real-dxgi copy), or leave dxgi as "late-load games only"** —
  Effort: **M-L** · Risk: med (loader-time code + deploy flow). **Deferred by owner (2026-06-19); Octopath uses version.dll for now, and the UI default is back to version.dll.** The dxgi proxy instant-exits on games that call dxgi **extremely early — under the loader lock, before our CRT is initialised** (Octopath Traveler: debugger-confirmed across 3 distinct crash dumps — execute-0 / `__tzset` uninit CRT lock / `RtlAllocateHeap` null heap; see dev-log 2026-06-19). Two genuine early-load fixes shipped + kept (`Sein::GetTimestamp`→Win32 `GetLocalTime`; dxgi lazy self-resolving thunks), but they do NOT make Octopath's dxgi work — the **root blocker** is that `LoadLibraryW(real same-named System32\dxgi.dll)` returns NULL under the early loader lock. **version.dll dodges it all by being called at normal runtime, not under early loader lock.** Robust fix = **thin-shim split (like RE-UE4SS):** `dxgi.dll` becomes a tiny CRT-free forwarder that (a) loads the real dxgi via a **renamed copy** (`dxgi_orig.dll`) to dodge the same-base-name-under-lock failure, and (b) `LoadLibrary("UE5Dumper.dll")` to run the heavy dumper as a **separate, normally-named, late-loaded** DLL. Deploy becomes **2 files** (`dxgi.dll` + `UE5Dumper.dll`) → the Proxy Deploy panel's deploy/undeploy/redundancy/Update-All must copy/remove both. NOTE: `/MD` (dynamic VCRuntime/UCRT) alone is only a **partial** fix — it removes the CRT-init crashes (Octopath already loads the shared UCRT early) but NOT the loader-lock same-name `LoadLibrary` blocker (that resurfaces as execute-0). version.dll/dinput8.dll don't need any of this (they load late). *Parent: dxgi proxy build 1172; early-load diagnosis + 2 fixes build 1351 (dev-log 2026-06-19).*

- **UE5.7+ packed FUObjectItem — live-verify + calibrate when a packed game appears** —
  Effort: **S** (mostly verify) · Risk: low (gated, last-resort only). Packed parsing shipped
  build 1108 but is **UNVERIFIED** (no `UE_ENABLE_FUOBJECT_ITEM_PACKING` game exists yet). When
  one does: attach, watch for the `*** UNVERIFIED ... PACKED ... ACTIVATED ***` WARN (or force via
  `set_packed_consts {force:true}`), then tune `align_bits`/`ptr_mask_bits`/`serial_off` against the
  echoed `GObjects[0..7]` samples until names resolve; confirm the object walk + a CE XML/CSX export
  are correct; then promote out of UNVERIFIED (drop the badge gate, pin the constants).
  Open sub-question: the packed **SerialNumber** offset (currently best-effort `0x0C`) is unpinned.
  *Parent: PackedItem.h + Aura packed mode + set_packed_consts shipped build 1108 (dev-log 2026-06-14).*

- **DLL cancellation — live-game verification** — Effort: **0** (verify only) · Risk:
  low. Confirm in-game that (a) disabling the script / closing the game while a long
  scan runs no longer hangs, (b) closing the UI mid-scan stops the DLL and a reopened
  UI reconnects promptly.
  *Parent: cooperative cancel + shutdown-abort + disconnect monitor shipped build
  936-937, PR #238 (dev-log 2026-06-06).*

- **Guess? "missing" mid-object data — RESOLVED (working as designed; diagnostic kept).** The
  `WALK:guess` diagnostic (build 1364+, `Ubel.cpp` `WalkInstance` fillGaps block, one line per
  Guess? walk, opt-in-gated) confirmed it **live on Elliot `LSGameWork`**: `0x170=16(ArrayProperty)`
  covers `0x170–0x180` and `0x180=80(MapProperty)` covers `0x180–0x1D0` exactly — the region the user
  saw "missing" is the inline allocator bytes of a TArray + TMap, fully owned by reflected container
  properties. The `GAPS:` list has nothing in `0x170–0x1D0` (only small padding/bitfield holes like
  `[0x3,0x8)`, `[0xA04,0xA3C)`). So `Guess?` correctly emits no raw rows there — CE dissect just
  flattens the container internals; our walker shows them as expandable Array/Map rows. **No code
  change.** The diagnostic line is kept as the standing answer to future "why doesn't Guess? show
  region X" questions (gated on `Guess?` being on). Optional future nicety: a `docs/tips.md` note that
  container internals aren't decomposed into guessed rows. *Parent: Guess-What leading-gap fix (builds
  1330-1333) + diagnostic (build 1364, this session); confirmed live 2026-06-19.*

- **Native-C Value Scan — P0–P3 ALL SHIPPED on dev; only in-game verify of P3 remains** —
  Effort: **0** (verify only) · Risk: low. Full design + status in
  [native-c-value-scan-spec.md](native-c-value-scan-spec.md). Opt-in raw/unmanaged
  (non-`UPROPERTY`) scan for native HP/MP via "Guess What" (`Ubel::GuessGapTypes`), across
  Value Search + Group Scan + Snapshot→SPC→Pivot. **DONE + in-game VERIFIED:** P1 single
  (Octopath), P2 group (FF7 Rebirth). **P3 DONE (build+tests+AOT green):**
  `CaptureSnapshotChunk(captureNativeC)` → `AppendRawHoleFields` (GuessGapTypes →
  `NormalizeGuessedTypeToProperty` → drop Pointer/Padding → `<raw@0xNN>` fields,
  numericScope-filtered, ≤256/obj); pipe `native_c` on `snapshot_chunk`; C#
  `SnapshotViewModel.IncludeNativeFields` toggle + intro string. SPC Query + Class Pivot
  consume raw rows with ZERO code changes (key on prop_name=offset + canonical declared_type;
  existing `fields` schema, no migration). **REMAINING: in-game verify P3** — BLOCKED on the
  snapshot-perf item below (FF7 Rebirth capture with Native-C didn't finish — 16+ min, >50%
  uncaptured). Verify on a smaller / faster game, or after the perf work: capture a native
  snapshot pair around a stat change, confirm SPC diff tracks a `<raw@0x..>` value + Class
  Pivot decodes it (not hex).
  *Parent: P0–P3 shipped on dev (this session); builds on value_search_caveats, the `Orden`
  seam (group-value-scan-spec §3.1), and the "Guess What" build (commit 75ea723).*

- **Snapshot capture too slow on huge games (FF7 Rebirth ~433K objects) — esp. with Native-C** —
  Effort: **M-L** · Risk: med (touches the hot capture path). FF7 Rebirth snapshot with
  Native-C ON ran **16+ min and left >50% of objects uncaptured**, so P3 couldn't be verified
  there. Likely causes, in order: (1) **Native-C `AppendRawHoleFields` calls `Ubel::GuessGapTypes`,
  which reads memory BYTE-BY-BYTE** (the zero-run probe does one `Macht::ReadSafe<uint8_t>` per
  byte) — over every hole of every object that's very slow. **FIX SHIPPED (this session):** `Ubel::GuessGapTypes` now reads the whole gap
  ONCE into a reused `thread_local` buffer and guesses in-buffer — the per-position AND
  per-byte (zero-run probe) SEH reads are eliminated; output is byte-identical; an SEH
  fallback is kept for a faulting / over-large gap. Also speeds up LiveWalker "Guess What".
  (still 10+ min after this fix, so the round-trip overhead below dominates too.) (2)
  ~~one pipe round-trip per 200 objects~~ **CHUNK RAISED 200 → 1000 (this session, 待測 /
  in-game re-test pending):** `Constants.SnapshotChunkSize` — ~2166 chunks → ~433 for 433K
  objects, also cutting the per-chunk SQLite write-transaction count. Safe (byte-mode pipe +
  `StreamReader.ReadLineAsync` accumulate any size; DLL 15s per-chunk deadline re-chunks slow
  chunks). **NEEDS in-game re-test on FF7 Rebirth — if still too slow, the bottleneck is the
  single-threaded DLL walk → do (3).** Could raise further / batch SQLite inserts if needed.
  (3) ~~DLL `CaptureSnapshotChunk` is single-threaded~~ **PARALLELIZED (this session, 待測 /
  in-game re-test pending):** the per-object capture loop now runs across worker threads via
  `ParallelGObjectsScan` (each worker fills its own `SnapshotObject` vector, merged after; whole
  chunk processed → `scanned` stays contiguous for the pager; Tot-cancel only, no wall-clock
  early return). Chunk size raised to **8192** so each full chunk clears `ScanThreadCount`'s
  >=8192 worker-thread threshold + amortizes the per-chunk cancel watcher. Verified by an
  adversarial 3-lens race/correctness audit (capture-helper statics, GuessGapTypes/WalkClassEx
  copy-out, pager contiguity) — no crash/corruption/mis-paging; the worker stride-check was
  fixed to range-relative for prompt cancel. **NEEDS in-game re-test on FF7 Rebirth** (combined
  with the GuessGapTypes + chunk wins, this is the big one). (4) **Source-level noise skip
  SHIPPED (builds 1484-1486, dev, in-game verify pending):** the "Auto detect Engine/System
  noise" option (default ON) `continue`s past pure engine/system classes (UI widgets, textures,
  sounds, Niagara, anim instances, `/Script` engine packages) in the capture loop BEFORE the
  per-field walk — cutting the dominant per-object cost for the many noise objects a big game
  carries + shrinking the DB, with a gameplay guardrail that force-keeps Actor/Pawn/Character/
  component-derived classes. Complements (1)-(3); especially helps games heavy in engine UI/FX
  objects. Still open if needed: class-scoped capture (only a chosen class's instances) + a
  clearer "X% captured" progress.
  *Parent: Native-C P3 in-game test (FF7 Rebirth), this session.*

- **DynOff calibrated offsets are non-atomic — tighten the second writer (low-risk hardening)** —
  Effort: **S** · Risk: low. The race audit of the parallel snapshot flagged a PRE-EXISTING
  technical data race the parallel readers widen: `DynOff::FSTRUCTPROP_STRUCT` (and the sibling
  calibrated `DynOff::` ints) are non-atomic. `Ubel::CorrectSubclassOffsets` serializes its writes
  (`s_calibrationMutex` + acquire/release `s_checked`), but there's a SECOND unguarded writer at
  `Ubel.cpp:~4288` (`DynOff::FSTRUCTPROP_STRUCT = tryOffset;` inside `WalkInstance`), and the
  snapshot/WalkClassEx-enrichment readers aren't gated by `s_checked`. Benign in practice
  (idempotent convergent writes + aligned-int load/store atomicity on x64), so NOT a crash risk,
  but technically UB. Lowest-risk fix: drop the redundant `~4288` write (verify `CorrectSubclassOffsets`
  already covers that calibration first — don't regress StructProperty struct-name resolution), or
  make the calibrated offsets `std::atomic<int>` with relaxed loads. *Parent: parallel-snapshot race audit, this session.*

## Related Objects panel — Phase 2 + follow-ups (Phase 1 shipped builds 1323-1327)

Phase 1 (the "Related" tab: given an actor, list Self/Class/Outer + Controller↔Pawn + owned components/ASC/AttributeSet via a depth-3 owned walk; 🌍 GWorld / Live Walker / finder / copy per row; 🔗 Related handoff from Instance Finder / Value Search / Live Walker) + the Instance Finder **"Newest first"** opt-in shipped builds 1323-1326. **In-game VERIFIED on TQ2:** `bp_ai_default_character_C` → Related lists 58 objects incl. `TQ2AIController`, `GrimAbilitySystemComponent` (ASC), `bp_tq2_character_stats_component_C` (AttributesComponent) → `AttributeSetHealth.CurrentHealth` = live HP (73.57). **Phase 2 (`Edel` current-target auto-detect) SHIPPED build 1400** (dev-log 2026-06-20) — `🎯 Detect target` button resolves GWorld→PC→Pawn, scores the player's outgoing object-ptr fields (structural is-Actor gate + keyword boost), auto-loads the top candidate; the `Edel` roster name is now 🟢. Remaining follow-ups, in order:

- **Phase 2 Edel — in-game verification + tuning** — Effort: **0** (verify only) · Risk: low. Built + unit-tested + AOT-green but unproven live. Verify on a **lock-on / soft-target action title** (the target lives in a `UPROPERTY` object field): click 🎯 Detect target → confirm the top candidate IS the focused enemy and its AttributeSet/HP shows in the grid; confirm the 🌍 Locate-in-GWorld now resolves for that target (it should — the player references it). On the named JP/CN test games (TQ2/SEED/DQ7R, mostly no target `UPROPERTY`) confirm the **graceful fallback** fires (note = "no clear target / weak guesses", nothing auto-loaded) rather than feeding a wrong actor. Tune the score constants / keyword tables only if a real game motivates it. *Parent: Edel shipped build 1400, dev-log 2026-06-20.*

- **Locate in GWorld — streaming / World-Partition actors — ADDRESSED via the world's level list (build 1405); in-game verify pending** — Effort: **0** (verify only) · Risk: low. `Aura::RecoverViaWorldLevel` now recovers a `not_reachable` actor through its owning `ULevel` (reached by the `ULevel::OwningWorld` back-reference, since an actor's Outer IS its level), emitting `world →(WorldLevel)→ ULevel → Actors[k] → actor [→ target]` with status `ok_via_level`. This makes ANY actor that belongs to the current world locatable + navigable in Live Walker (and a bounded tail BFS reaches an owned AttributeSet/HP), regardless of how its level was streamed in — closing the Elliot "weapons map, enemies don't" case. **Verify in-game:** on a streaming/WP title, 🌍 on a just-spawned enemy now lands (status note: "via the world's level list"); confirm the breadcrumb spine reaches the enemy and you can drill to its HP. Two honest residual limits (acceptable, not bugs): (1) the chain is NOT a clean CE static-pointer chain (the world→level hop is a back-reference) — it's for in-tool navigation; (2) a truly unreferenced actor not in ANY world level still returns `not_reachable` (correct). Edel (build 1400) remains the complementary path when the player references the target. *Parent: Related Objects Phase 1 in-game test (dev-log 2026-06-19); recovery dev-log 2026-06-20.*

- **Locate from GEngine — alternate root for UI-widget / GameInstance-owned objects** — ✅ **DONE (builds 1542-1544, MERGED main PR #345 `f488592`; in-game VERIFIED)** — shipped as **Locate in GameEngine** (⚙ icon on all 10 🌍 surfaces). The existing `find_path_from_gworld` handler gained a `root_kind` field (`engine` → `rootObj = Genau::FindGameEngine().engineAddr`, `no_engine` when absent); `FindObjectGraphPath` was already root-agnostic so it was untouched. Reaches engine-layer objects (GameInstance / LocalPlayer / GameViewport / UMG widgets — the Octopath `PartyCharacterPanel_C` case) that no GWorld chain reaches; a deliberate complement to 🌍 (weaker for world actors, since `RecoverViaWorldLevel`/`ok_via_level` is World-root-gated). See dev-log 2026-06-22. *Residual: `deadline_ms` still hardcoded 20000ms in `FindObjectGraphPath` — optional follow-up.*

## Multiple Values Group Scan — remaining phases (P1 shipped build 1276)

P1 (object-aware group scan, direct numeric leaves + one-level struct descent, exact-per-slot, mode toggle + master-detail UI) shipped builds 1276-1278 — new `Orden` SDR matcher. Follow-ups, in order:

- ~~**P1 in-game verification**~~ **DONE** — verified on SEED (UE4.27): single Value Search + Group Search both pass; Deep mode surfaces the buried `Tunes` block. *(dev-log 2026-06-18.)*

- ~~**P2 — prev-value per slot + offset-table**~~ **DONE (builds 1295-1302)** — per-slot scan type now on `Orden::SlotTarget` (`st`+`tolerance`+`targets2`, routed through `ComparePredicate`) + `RefineGroupCandidates`: First Scan takes Exact/Bigger/Smaller/**Between** per slot (Between = bounded-unknown entry, e.g. HP in [1,100]), Next Scan also takes the prev-value four (Changed/Unchanged/Increased/Decreased — compare each leaf vs its own previous round). Locked-offset table (`🔒 Class — Str@0x20, Def@0x24`) shows once all slots lock. **"Copy CE Script" / export is a deliberate WON'T-DO (not pending work)** — the owner exports the resolved chain from Live Walker (which already does it); do not re-add a group-side CE/export button. **prev-value group refine in-game VERIFIED on SEED** (Unchanged/Unchanged/Increased ran clean); Between first-scan live-verify still nice-to-have. *(dev-log 2026-06-18.)*

- **P3 — numeric containers as blocks — DONE (opt-in Deep, builds 1283-1285; scalar maps builds 1561-1562)**. The "Deep" toggle treats each numeric `TArray/TSet` + each struct-array/map element as its own block via the recursive `WalkContainerLeaves`, matching the group WITHIN one array (finds the SEED `Tunes[N]` case); single-value Deep forces the existing deep pass on all classes. The scalar-map follow-up added **scalar-valued + scalar-keyed maps** (`TMap<Name,int>` → value block `<map>.Value`, key block `<map>.Key`) by extending `ContainerCacheEntry` with `keyLeafType`/`valueLeafType` — closes the walker TODO **and** the Value Search "Proper scalar-map value/key capture" item (one shared fix); struct sides byte-identical, adversarial 4-lens review 0-confirmed. *Remaining (verify only):* in-game verify of the Deep path + a scalar-map (`Map<Name,int>`) game on SEED. *Parent: dev-log 2026-06-18 deep entry + 2026-06-22 scalar-map entry.*

- **Snapshot Group Match follow-ups — feature S1-S5 SHIPPED + MERGED main PR #348, in-game VERIFIED on SEED** (spec: [snapshot-group-match-spec.md](snapshot-group-match-spec.md); dev-log 2026-06-23). Remaining optional work, same `Orden` matcher: **(1)** SPC Query "N-field intersection" + **(2)** Class Pivot "co-varying tuples" (spec §3.1 rows 2-3); **(3)** array-AS-BLOCK deep (each nested array its own block, like the live deep — S5 shipped object-flat: array elements as the owner's leaves); **(4)** the snapshot-wide >2^53 double-precision limitation (carry exact target bytes per width like the DLL's `NumericTargetSet` — affects SPC/Diff/Pivot too, not just group match). All low priority — pick up if a real case motivates it.

-----

## Locate-in-GWorld — `IsGWorldAvailable` gate decouple (Value Search done, others pending)

- **Decouple the other panels' 🌍 from `IsGWorldAvailable`** — Effort: **S** · Risk: low. Value Search's per-row/per-slot "Locate in GWorld" was gated `IsEnabled="{Binding IsGWorldAvailable}"` (and the command short-circuited on it); on TQ2 (proxy mode) the flag read false even though GWorld was resolved, so the button was silently disabled (no `find_path` sent, no feedback). Fixed for Value Search (build 1311) by decoupling — the button is always clickable and the DLL's `find_path_from_gworld` (which returns `invalid`/`no path` with no live UWorld) is the source of truth. **The same gate still exists on Instance Finder / Snapshot / SPC 🌍 buttons** — apply the same decouple if a user hits it there. Open question worth a quick check: *why* did `IsGWorldAvailable` (an `[ObservableProperty]` fed from `state.HasGWorld`, which was true) evaluate false in the button binding on TQ2 — a binding-resolution quirk in the group RowDetails template vs a real state-propagation timing bug. *(dev-log 2026-06-18.)*

## CE export drilldown — remaining gaps (Phase A/B/C shipped)

Phase A (CE XML/Field container-value expansion, build 1085), Phase B (CSX parity,
build 1098), Phase C (depth-from-current-view tests + CSX truncation note, build
1098) all shipped. Spec: [ce-export-drilldown-spec.md](ce-export-drilldown-spec.md).
Open follow-ups (low priority):

- **CSX struct-array element full re-walk** — Effort: **S** · Risk: low. CSX struct
  arrays still flatten the shallow Phase-F `StructFields` preview, so nested
  structs/maps *inside* an array element stay shallow. CE XML's
  `EmitStructArrayProperty` already re-walks each element via `resolvedStructs`
  (build 1076); mirror that in `ConvertArrayStructElementsToFields` (stamp
  `StructDataAddr` per element + route to `EmitStructPropertyFlattened`). The unified
  resolver already populates `resolvedStructs` for array struct elements — only the
  CSX emit path ignores it.
- **Nested-container truncation note** — Effort: **S** · Risk: low. The
  `⚠ Container element limit` note (CE XML + CSX) only scans top-level fields; a
  container clipped by `ArrayLimit` *inside* a drilled struct/pointer is unreported.
  Cheap: scan `resolvedStructs`/`resolvedInstances` values too. (Marked optional in
  the spec.)
- **FName → live readable string in CE via a "UE FName to String" custom type** —
  Effort: **M-L** · Risk: med (CE-Lua + per-game GNames config). Highest-value of the
  remaining sample.CSX gaps. Today FName is shown statically: **CSX** emits a raw
  8-byte qword (`MapCsxType` `NameProperty`→`8 Bytes` — no name at all); **Copy CE XML /
  Field** emit the 4-byte `ComparisonIndex` + a static `DropDownList` snapshot (index→string
  captured at export time, arrays only; single scalar FNames mostly show the raw index).
  sample.CSX instead uses `Vartype="Custom" Customtype="UE FName to String"` — a CE custom
  type (Lua, registered via `registerCustomTypeLua`) that resolves the FName index against
  GNames **live, inside CE, at runtime**, so any FName value updates to its current string.
  The exporter change is the easy 10% (emit `Custom`/`Customtype` for `NameProperty`, opt-in,
  keep DropDownList as fallback); the real work is **shipping + auto-configuring a GNames-aware
  FName custom-type Lua**: parse the pool block layout (UE4 `TNameEntry` vs UE5 `FNamePool`,
  stride/casing — knowledge already in the DLL's `Serie` module) and feed it the live GNames
  address. GNames must be **ASLR/restart-stable** → reuse the AOB / GWorld-anchor recovery from
  the Copy CE AA Script work (dev-log 2026-06-21). Benefits all three exporters (CSX gains names
  at all; CE XML/Field gain live resolution vs the frozen snapshot + single-scalar coverage).
  Decide: keep DropDownList as a no-setup fallback when the custom type isn't installed.
  *Parent: CSX 7.7+ Binary format + sample.CSX audit (dev-log 2026-06-21, PR #335); FNamePool =
  `Serie` module; GNames anchor = `project-aa-script-gworld-walk`.*

## Teleport — follow-ups (deferred / future research)

Teleport shipped (Wirbel, build 1027-1043). Works where the possessed pawn is
the visible character (SEED) and, via the deep-force, even on hard-cooked HD-2D
titles (Octopath — character moves). Open items, all per-game / research-grade:

- **Camera/POV doesn't follow on hard-cooked games (Octopath / SE HD-2D)** —
  Effort: **M-L** · Risk: med. **Read-only camera-POV display DONE + LIVE-VERIFIED
  builds 1110-1112** (Teleport tab → "Camera POV" → Get POV; `Wirbel::GetPov` +
  `teleport_get_pov` + a "Get camera POV" mailbox AA record). POV now **reads on
  all four tested titles** — getters on SEED / DQ III, and a fully-reflected
  `CameraCachePrivate.POV` raw fallback on TQ2 / Octopath (getters present but
  `ProcessEvent` returns nothing) — so you can *measure* the camera↔pawn delta.
  **That's the READ; the actual camera-FOLLOW-after-teleport fix below is still
  open** (POV read confirms the divergence but doesn't move the camera). Phase 2 ideas: FOV set/reset (`SetFOV`/`LockedFOV` is the only
  persistently-settable POV component); a "re-anchor camera" nudge after teleport
  (`SetViewTargetWithBlend(pawn,0)` + `SetGameCameraCutThisFrame()`). There is no
  universal Set POV — `UpdateCamera` overwrites it every tick. See
  [teleport-spec.md](teleport-spec.md) §15.
  The deep-force moves the pawn's root
  `ComponentToWorld`, but the camera tracks a separate child component
  (SpringArm / CameraComponent) or follow-camera actor whose world transform we
  never refresh — so the view stays put and can get **stuck unrecoverably**
  (no in-game event re-syncs the view-target chain; a save reload / area
  transition fixes it). Options, in order of cheapness: (1) invoke
  `APlayerController::SetViewTargetWithBlend(pawn, 0)` to re-anchor (likely also
  cooked out on these titles); (2) `APlayerCameraManager::SetGameCameraCutThisFrame()`
  for an instant cut; (3) deep-force the follow-camera component's
  `ComponentToWorld` too (need to *find* it — game-specific); (4) recompute
  child world transforms (manual `UpdateChildTransforms` — native, no
  reflection, hard). **Deferred**: no universal solution; a failed camera nudge
  risks making the stuck-camera worse. In-app disclaimer covers it.
- **TQ2 teleport — FIXED (build 1113); two minor caveats remain.** The old
  "separate visible actor" theory was **disproven** (build 1113 ViewTarget
  diagnostic): TQ2's pawn IS the camera view-target and owns the mesh + CMC. The
  failure was `K2_SetActorLocation` reporting success but not moving + a stale
  cached transform; fixed by always running `K2_SetWorldLocation` + deep-force in
  the CMC-freeze path. Marker teleport now works. Remaining: **(a) cursor teleport
  blocked** — TQ2 strips `GetMousePosition` (returns 0,0 / virtual cursor),
  `GetViewportSize`, and `KismetSystemLibrary`, so there's no generic way to read
  the cursor target (per-game RE only — low value, deferred); **(b) minor visual
  lag** — the mesh snaps over on the next move after a marker teleport (CMC network
  smoothing; a CMC smoothing-offset reset would fix it, Effort S, deferred). See
  [lessons-learned.md](lessons-learned.md) "TQ2 verdict".
- **Gamepad / mouse-extra-button hotkeys** — Effort: **M** · Risk: low.
  Marker hotkey capture is keyboard-only (`RegisterHotKey`). Mouse extra buttons
  + gamepad need low-level hooks / XInput polling ("record on all-released" per
  the user's spec). Deferred until requested.

## Value Search — coverage + memory (build 923 plan)

Dependency order was **V3-A → V3-B → V1a → V3-C → V2**; **all shipped** (V3-C build 949:
DLL owns the set, UI is a server-side-filtered/sorted window; V2 build 954: ceiling
raised to 1M, sort/filter verified sub-second). Remaining open: **V1b** (container
prev-value refine) and **V1c live-verify**.

- **Deep Value-Search candidate → multi-level 🌍 drill** — ✅ **DONE build 1208.**
  Generalised `TryParseStructArrayInner`/`DrillToStructArrayInnerAsync` into
  `TryParseContainerPath` + `DrillDisplayPathAsync` (parse the full multi-`[N]`
  display path into ordered `(name,index)` segments; drill each as a container
  hop or direct-struct field; land on the final leaf). Wired into BOTH the VS/SPC
  `LocateInGWorldAsync` reach branch AND `NavigateToInstanceFieldAsync`
  (Open-in-Live-Walker — also fixes the offset-0 mis-select for deep candidates).
  Verified by a 4-agent audit (drill-sites + scan/capture correctness); the value
  was always FOUND — this was the land-ON-it polish. ⚠ in-game live-verify pending
  (multi-`[N]` 🌍 should land exactly on the SEED `...Tunes[N]` value).

- **Top-level `TSet<FStruct>` / `TMap<K,FStruct>` depth-1 inner leaves (Value Search)** —
  Effort: **S/M** · Risk: low. The static depth-1 collector (`collectStructArrayInner`)
  only covers `TArray<FStruct>`; the recursive `deepEmit` skips `depth<2` to avoid
  double-counting it. So the DIRECT fields of a struct element in a *top-level*
  Set/Map are scanned by neither path. (Nested ones — the SEED `MsTunes` case — are
  depth≥2 and ARE caught.) Fix: add a Set/Map analogue to `collectStructArrayInner`,
  or relax `deepEmit` to `depth>=1` for the Set/Map element side only. Audit #2.

- **SPC Strict-join `prop_offset` migration edge** — Effort: **S** · Risk: low.
  1-level struct-array element rows now store `prop_offset=0` (build 1205, was
  `nf.Offset`); a Strict-mode SPC query that mixes a pre-1205 and a post-1205
  snapshot keys the same logical field differently. Either zero `prop_offset` for
  array-element rows in the Strict key, or bump the schema to force recapture.
  Audit #4. *Cosmetic unless mixing snapshots across the 1205 boundary.*

- **Interesting Props: optional "Locate in GWorld" 🌍** — ✅ **DONE (builds 1531+, MERGED main PR #344 `86fb765`; in-game VERIFIED)** — added a leftmost per-row 🌍 icon column that resolves a live non-CDO instance of the row's class then calls `LocateInGWorldAsync(addr, 0, null, stopAtParent:true)` (the Interesting Functions handoff, gated on `IsGWorldAvailable`). Same PR added the prominent Live Walker failure banner. The panel also gained the ⚙ Locate in GameEngine button via PR #345. See dev-log 2026-06-22.

- **V1b — container prev-value refine (stable key)** — Effort: **M** · Risk: **high**.
  `Candidate.addr` stores a raw element address; TArray realloc already makes it stale,
  and TSparseArray is worse — freed slots get reused, so `c.addr` on refine may point at
  a different logical entry → Changed/Unchanged semantics silently lie. Store
  `container addr + slot index` as a stable key and re-walk the sparse array on refine
  (same idea as snapshot's `SelectArrayInnerKey`). **Do only if refine-on-container is
  actually requested.**
  *Parent: V1a TSet/TMap key|value scan shipped First-Scan-only, build 927 (dev-log
  2026-06-06).*

## Experimental: Snapshot / SPC / Class Pivot

Gated behind the System-tab opt-in (`IExperimentalGate`). Design of record:
[experimental-snapshot-spc-pivot.md](experimental-snapshot-spc-pivot.md). Phases
0/A/B/C (C1+C3-lite+C4+C5+C6) + N1 noise picker all shipped; the engine rework
(in-memory hash-joins), heavy-query cancellation, persisted pivot index, and
Windows-only AOT backend all shipped (dev-log builds 805–923).

- **C2 — find-by-value locator + pivot handoff** — Effort: **M** · Risk: **med**.
  Closes the loop: locate which class/field holds a known value, then hand off into
  Class Pivot.
  *Parent: Pivot Phase C (C1/C3-lite/C4/C5/C6) shipped builds 830-877 (dev-log).*

- **A3c — CE .CT freeze-export from a diff/SPC/pivot hit** — Effort: **M** · Risk: low.
  Copy Address already covers the manual path; this is the full automated freeze export.
  *Parent: A3 diff engine + Copy Address shipped build 817.*

- **Heavier C3 scorer** — Effort: **M** · Risk: med. Jaccard stability + greedy compound
  key + class shortlist / volatility ranking (the "29i-3" scorer).
  *Parent: C3-lite key scorer shipped build 830.*

- **N1 v2 — per-`(class, prop)` deny granularity** — Effort: **M** · Risk: low. v1 is
  by-class; some classes (`ACharacter`, `APawn`) carry both gameplay fields (`Health`)
  and noise (`Velocity`, `LastRenderTime`). v2 would chevron-expand each Top-N row to its
  Top-K noisiest props. **Defer until v1 proves the bulk case is solved.**
  *Parent: N1 per-tab class denylist shipped builds 908-910 (dev-log 2026-06-05).*

- *(optional)* **`discrete`-style gzip blob storage** — Effort: M · Risk: low. Only if
  snapshot DB size becomes a real concern.

-----

## Bytecode cross-reference: property ↔ function — deferred follow-ups

Path 1 (BP Kismet bytecode) core + v2a, and Path 2 (native via Zydis/Denken) forward
direction, both shipped (dev-log builds 838-872).

- **Path 1 v2b — CFG-precise attribution** — Effort: **L** · Risk: **med-high**. v2a's
  "nearest entry offset" mis-attributes a sub-graph reached from multiple events via
  jumps; the `EX_Let*` write detector misses wrapped LHS (`Other.Field` / `Struct.Member`
  / `Arr[i] = x`). A real variable-length decoder (follow `EX_Jump` / `EX_JumpIfNot` /
  `EX_ComputedJump`, parse the LHS expression tree) fixes both. Reference:
  `vendor/RE-UE4SS/.../KismetDebugger.cpp` (`render_expr`) + `EExprToken`. **Only when a
  real mis-attribution motivates the cost.**
  *Parent: Path 1 + v2a shipped builds 838-861.*

- **Path 2 follow-ups** — (a) **reverse direction** (property → native funcs; needs
  disassembling every native function per query — expensive); (b) **SIB-indexed**
  `[reg+idx*scale+disp]` accesses (currently skipped); (c) **CFG-aware branch following**
  (only fall-through + direct call/tail-jmp followed today); (d) live tuning of the
  `this`-tracking + Func-offset detector across more games.
  *Parent: Path 2 native UFunction analysis shipped builds 862-872.*

-----

## Call-UE-function / invoke

- **#2 Live ProcessEvent Call Profiler** — Effort: **M-L** · Risk: **med** (PE is hot
  path). Rank UFunctions by **observed behaviour** instead of name heuristics. `Stark`
  already ticks `s_hookFireCount` — extend with a per-UFunction atomic counter + a
  "Recording" toggle + 3 pipe cmds (`start/stop/get_pe_profile`) + a "Live Funcs" tab.
  Workflow: Start → perform action ("open inventory") → Stop → see what fired. Keep
  PE hot-path overhead < 100ns/call (lockless atomic; benchmark before shipping).
  Biggest blast radius of the picks.

- **#7 View Snap Hotkey (Property → snap-to-step)** — Effort: **S-M** · Risk: **low**.
  Bind a CE hotkey that snaps a Float/Double property to the next N° step (rotation
  snap) — generalises to MoveSpeed multipliers, zoom levels, time-dilation cycling.
  New row action + `SnapHotkeyDialog` + `scripts/ue5_snap_helper.lua` +
  `SnapHotkeyScriptGenerator.cs`. **95% mirrors the build-719 freeze Route B.**

- **Add-on: AA(Baked) "Auto-tick every N ms"** — Effort: **S** · Risk: low. Wrap the
  generated `invokeUFunction` call in a `createTimer(N, callback)` block ([DISABLE] tears
  it down); same per-script keyed handle table as FreezeScript. Lands as a 1-day add-on
  after #7 (both touch the script generator + dialog).

- **#5 v2 — ObjectProperty return resolution + recursive struct expansion** —
  Effort: **S + S**. (a) Resolve ObjectProperty/ClassProperty returns to "Name (Class)"
  via a DLL pipe round-trip (`resolve_object_name(addr)` or extend the invoke response).
  (b) Recursively expand nested structs (`FHitResult.Location` → its own FVector rows).
  *Parent: #5 structured-return DataGrid shipped build 775, PR #211.*

- **#0c FTransform Translation offset** — Effort: **S** · Risk: low. `VectorStructNames
  (FTransform)` returns empty → zero hits. Needs per-version Translation offset detection
  (UE4 / UE5-non-LWC at +16, UE5 LWC at +32).
  *Parent: Value Search Phase 2 vectors shipped build 757, PR #208.*

- **FString / FText / TArray input in baked AA Script** — Effort: **M** · Risk: **med**.
  Functions like `KismetSystemLibrary::PrintString` are observable side-effect verify
  targets but unreachable — the helper's `writeBakedParams` only handles scalar inputs.
  Needs CE-side buffer alloc + FString header write (ptr/count/max) + keep-alive + free
  in the cleanup timer. Same pattern for FText + TArray-of-scalars. (Open since the build
  643-644 ES2 live test.)

- **LiveWalker batch generator (v2 of the CT batch)** — Effort: **S-M**. Heterogeneous
  rows (functions + fields + struct sub-fields + array elements) + drilldown state — needs
  its own UX pass.
  *Parent: #3 multi-row → one .CT batch (Interesting Funcs/Props) shipped build 760.*

- **Dual-connection pipe (eliminate head-of-line blocking)** — Effort: **M** · Risk:
  **high** (in-process DLL concurrency). **POSTPONED 2026-06-01.** Full design:
  [multi-connection-pipe-proposal.md](multi-connection-pipe-proposal.md). Engine-side
  concurrency is already safe (builds 792/793 + SessionManager); residual risk is Fern's
  accept/shutdown rewrite. Benefit is moderate (parallel scans already shrank the blocking
  window) — revisit only if "UI freezes during a big scan" becomes a real pain.

- **KismetMathLibrary stub-pattern UX hint** — Effort: **S** · Risk: low. On UE 5.5+
  cooked Shipping, `KismetMathLibrary::Add_IntInt` etc. consistently return 0 (cooker
  strips the `execXxx` thunk). Add a "Recommended verification targets" footer hint when
  the selected class is `KismetMathLibrary` / `KismetSystemLibrary`, and update
  lessons-learned / test-games. (Not a feature to enable calling them — a UX redirect.)

- **Mimic: zero the ReturnValue slot before invoke** — Effort: **S** · Risk: low. ES2
  showed Before/After dumps identical (stale `0x49`) so we can't tell "wrote 73" from
  "didn't touch ReturnValue". Overwrite the slot with a sentinel / zero before calling PE
  so the After dump is unambiguous. ~2-line patch in `Mimic.cpp` (both fast path + game-
  thread dispatch).

- **CE Lua AA Script activation hang — UX hardening** — Effort: **M** (mitigation) ·
  Risk: low. AA Script sometimes never reaches the mailbox (CE Lua froze or hid an error).
  Mitigations: re-arm helper-injected check on UI Connect; mailbox heartbeat `print()`
  before the write; early-exit `if not g_invokeMailbox then showMessage(...) end` in the
  helper. (UX hardening, not a correctness bug — we can't distinguish AA-error from CE
  freeze from the DLL side.)

-----

## Property scoring / discovery

- **Class Family Browser (Proposal C)** — Effort: **L** · Risk: **med**. New "Class
  Family" tab bucketing game classes by inferred role (Character / Pawn / Inventory /
  Stats / Save / Components / DataAssets / DataTables / GameMode) — the "I have no idea
  where to start in a new game" entry point. **NOT a jump-in-and-code task** — the
  classification heuristic + UI design needs its own planning round (cluster the dump
  corpus's BPGCs by property-name similarity first).

- **Proposal B — per-row "similar BP-added properties"** — Effort: **M** · Risk: low.
  **DEFERRED indefinitely.** When the user lands on `bCanBeDamaged @ AActor`, surface a
  side-panel of fuzzy-matched game-specific bools (`bIsImmortal @ BP_PlayerCharacter_C`).
  B' (the broad-sweep Interesting Properties) already covers the workflow — revisit only
  if a real user reports the specific gap B fills.

- **Runtime `keywords.json` override** — Effort: **M** · Risk: **med**. Let users tune
  the scoring tables without recompiling (source-gen JSON for AOT; hardcoded fallback;
  additive vs replace mode; "Export current tables to JSON" seed button). **Only if a
  user actually asks.**

- **More-genre dump coverage (calibration)** — Effort: **S** (mostly user-side). The
  corpus is heavy on JRPG/sim/ARPG/FPS/racing/sandbox; missing MMO/fighting/horror/RTS/
  sports-sim. Dump 3-5 games per genre → re-run `scripts/analysis/analyze_dumps.py` → PR
  keyword adds with evidence attached.

-----

## Carryover capability gaps

Pick up when the active plan finishes or when blocked.

- **MulticastSparseDelegateProperty UE 4.23-4.27** — Effort: **L** · Risk: **med**.
  Closes the last delegate-flavour gap (UE5 landed in PR #194). UE4 needs a separate AOB
  + walker branch: outer key is `FObjectKey {FWeakObjectPtr; int32 SerialNumber}` (16B)
  not raw `UObjectBase*`, outer stride ~0x60 → ~0x68, key match reconstructs `FObjectKey`
  from `(owner, GetSerialNumber(InternalIndex))`. Walker currently returns
  `supported=false` for UE < 5.0.

- **Find Refs v4 — TMap / TSet weak-like inner sides** — Effort: **M** · Risk: **low**.
  Currently Object/Class only; weak/soft pointer collections (`TMap<UObject*,
  FWeakObjectPtr>` etc.) silently miss target hits. Reuse the v3 weak-resolve helper
  inside the existing TMap/TSet walkers in `Aura::FindReferencesToUObject`.

- **FieldPathProperty drill-down + Find Refs** — Effort: **M** · Risk: **low**. Last
  remaining no-handler property type. Rare in shipping games (only Editor-derived
  classes) — genuinely low priority.

- **GWorld coverage** — Effort: **S each** · Risk: low. Two remaining titles:
  - **Star Wars Jedi: Survivor** (UE 4.27?) — untested; needs an AOB sweep + result triage.
  - **Satisfactory** (UE 5.3, modular DLL build) — (1) proxy DLL injection fails (loader
    bypasses normal proxy hooking; workaround = CE manual injection); (2) GWorld pattern
    likely lives in `CoreUObject-Win64-Shipping.dll` — adapt `Genau::FindAll` to scan
    multiple modules when the primary scan fails.

- **`kPublishers[]` table additions** — Effort: **S each** · Risk: **high** (if added
  casually — wrong publisher bias overrides correct detection). Only add a publisher with
  ≥3 misdetected titles AND a clear pattern. Wait for real misdetection reports.

-----

## Pending live-game verification (verify only — no code)

Shipped + unit-tests-pass but unproven on real games:

- **Copy CE Field drills object-pointer arrays — leaf + GWorld-path spine + dup-crumb dedup — DONE +
  MERGED (PR #323, builds 1364-1379).** LEAF (`SpawnedAttributes[2]` → `CharacterAttributeSet` →
  `HealthPoint`), SPINE 2b (`PathStepToBreadcrumbs` splits a Locate-in-GWorld `PlayerArray[0]` hop into
  container + element), and DEDUP 2c (`DedupeConsecutiveBreadcrumbs` collapses a redundant consecutive
  container crumb in `ExportCeFieldXmlAsync` + `CleanBreadcrumbs`) all **LIVE-VERIFIED on Elliot AND the
  deeply-nested Gundam SEED chain** (nested + Collapse-chain). Unit-tested
  (`...ObjectArray_WithResolvedElement_DrillsElementGroup`, `...PathThroughObjectArrayElement_EmitsElementDerefNode`,
  `DedupeConsecutiveBreadcrumbs_*`, `..._DeepDistinctChain_Unchanged`). **(b) DONE + LIVE-VERIFIED
  (builds 1380-1388) — Back-nav onto a path-synthetic container crumb now re-hydrates the array element view.** The
  crumb's `ContainerField` is null (the `GWorldPathStep` carries no `ArrayDataAddr`/`ArrayCount`/element
  list), so Back-nav fell through to a parent re-walk and rendered the PARENT object grid (a silent
  mis-render — NOT a literal duplicate; the 2c dedup already covers the export-time crumb). "Give it a
  `ContainerField`" is infeasible (path step lacks the data) → `TryRepopulateSyntheticContainerAsync`
  LAZILY re-walks the parent + matches the field by name+offset + `RepopulateContainerView`, wired into
  all 4 re-display sites (NavigateToBreadcrumb, GoBack normal + pre-bookmark restore, LoadBookmark) +
  `RefreshAsync`'s container gate broadened. 7 new tests; C# 1648/0, AOT 46.5 MB. **(a) DONE +
  LIVE-VERIFIED (builds 1389-1390) — Map/Set (and interface-array) element hops in a GWorld-path spine
  now split into container + element crumbs.** The DLL `emit()` lambda was widened 6→8 args to thread `elemStride`
  (Map `pairStride` / Set `elemStride` / interface-array 16) + `elemValueOffset` (Map value's within-pair
  offset; 0 for set/key/interface) through `GraphEdge`/`GraphPathStep` → Fern `elem_stride`/`elem_value_offset`
  → C# `GWorldPathStep` → `PathStepToBreadcrumbs` (element crumb offset = `ElementIndex*stride + valueOffset`;
  container crumb strips the `.Key`/`.Value` suffix so Back-nav re-hydration matches). All emit callers
  updated (`GetRelatedObjects`/`AppendOwnedSubObjectLeaves`/test mock); object/class arrays keep the
  hardcoded-8 path. 6 new tests (5 C# + 1 dll round-trip); C++ 697/0, C# 1653/0, AOT 46.5 MB. Adversarial
  review confirmed Map/Set/Set offsets correct + reachable; accepted nits: struct-nested dotted base name
  doesn't re-hydrate (pre-existing, affects arrays too, CE math still correct) + int32 element-offset
  arithmetic (theoretical, `FieldOffset` is int by design).
- **Value Search `TOptional<T>` scan (V1c)** (build 942). Scan a known value held in a
  `TOptional<int/float/FString>` UPROPERTY → confirm the row appears under the optional's
  field name and a Next Scan prunes; confirm an **unset** optional doesn't surface on a
  scan for `0` (the `bIsSet` gate). Layout helper is unit-tested; the field walk needs a
  live game with optional UPROPERTYs.
- **Property freeze (Route B)** on a respawning-NPC game (build 719). Watch: tick FPS
  impact (50ms × N instances), rescan cadence at respawn, vtable-liveness guard on level
  transition, AOBMaker gating UX, multi-script coexistence. First candidate: Geri (UE
  4.27).
- **Build-648 ProcessEvent fix** re-verify on ES2 (UE 5.5) + Geri (UE 4.27): look for
  `GameThreadDispatch: validation OK — hook fired N times`; previously-`-5`-timing-out
  instance invokes should now succeed. Lower-priority extras: a UE 4.18-4.24 game (smaller
  vtable / lower slot) + a heavily-modified publisher fork.
- **Static-native PE fast path** (build 636) latency vs game-thread dispatch on an active
  session; confirm stateful UFunctions still route through dispatch (don't fall into the
  fast path by accident).
- **FPROPERTY_FLAGS offset fix** (build 642): sweep the 12+ tested games' Class Structure
  Return columns + confirm baked PARAMS no longer include ReturnValue as an input.
- **Verify Return Value diagnostic** (build 637/644): pointer-return shows `0x` prefix;
  FString-return shows the "see After: dump above" hint.
- **`walk_functions_batch` follow-up** — Effort: **S**. Sister to `walk_class_batch`;
  DumpAll still does `WalkFunctions` single-call per class. Same byte-equivalence safety
  net. **Skip unless profiling shows it as the new bottleneck.**

-----

## Speculative — pick if the active plan finishes ahead of schedule

Not yet committed to:

- **Invoke history / favorites panel** — auto-record (target, args, result) per
  invocation; one-click re-fire.
- **Dry-run-first invoke** — for never-called functions, invoke with zero/sentinel params
  first to detect a crash before committing real args.
- **CE table builder** — bundle selected pointer entries + AA scripts into a single `.ct`,
  auto-grouped by category (broader than the build-760 Interesting Funcs/Props batch).
- **Global hotkey binding** for shortlisted functions ("give 1000 gold" on Ctrl+G).
- **Property freeze — Route A (docs only)** — reuse CE XML/CSX export to land a pointer
  chain, user manually ticks Freeze in CE. Works today, no code; tradeoff is the chain
  binds to one resolved instance (breaks on respawn). Keep for one-shot static-singleton
  freezes so users don't have to wait for Route B.
