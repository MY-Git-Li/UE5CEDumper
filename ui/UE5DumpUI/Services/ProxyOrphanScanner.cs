///
/// <para>1. <b>A failed directory listing is never "empty".</b> A <see cref="DirProbe"/> returning
/// null means "could not read" and MUST refuse. Two measured routes to deleting live data:
/// <c>Directory.EnumerateFileSystemEntries</c>'s <c>EnumerationOptions</c> overload defaults to
/// <c>AttributesToSkip = Hidden | System</c>, so a folder holding a hidden save file enumerates as
/// holding only our DLL; and the <c>Enumerate*</c> family is LAZY, so a <c>foreach</c> wrapped in
/// <c>catch { }</c> yields a PARTIAL list that is indistinguishable from a complete short one.
/// The surrounding file's established idiom IS <c>catch { }</c> — correct for a scan, catastrophic
/// for a delete predicate. The impure shell must use the BARE overload and materialise inside the
/// try.</para>
///
/// <para>2. <b>Never <c>Directory.Delete(path, recursive: true)</c>.</b> The prune walks up one
/// level at a time with the NON-recursive overload, which throws unless the directory is truly
/// empty. That is a kernel-enforced emptiness check the plan cannot fake, it closes the
/// scan→confirm→delete race (anything created in between makes the delete throw and the walk
/// stops), and it is why <see cref="PlanPrune"/> does not need to assert emptiness of ancestors.
