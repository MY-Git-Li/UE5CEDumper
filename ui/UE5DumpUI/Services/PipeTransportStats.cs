/// Process-wide accumulator for time spent inside <see cref="PipeClient.SendAsync"/> —
/// the ONE extra measurement needed to decompose a heavy operation's cost.
///
/// <para><b>Why.</b> The build-2324 measurement showed a heavy export spends
/// <c>0.088 ms</c> per call inside the DLL and <c>0.208 ms</c> per call somewhere
/// else, and concluded that batching <c>walk_instance</c> is the real lever — but
/// it could not say how much of that 0.208 ms batching would actually recover.
/// Pipe latency disappears when 200 calls become one; UI-side per-result work does
/// not. Promising a speed-up without that split would be guessing.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The split this enables.</b> Transport is measured here; the DLL's own
/// dispatch time already comes from <c>Sense</c>; the operation's wall-clock is
/// measured by <see cref="DiagnosticsProbe"/>. Three numbers give all four parts:</para>
/// <list type="bullet">
///   <item><c>dll</c> = Sense dispatcher busy — the actual work.</item>
///   <item><c>ipc</c> = transport − dll — pure pipe/IPC latency. <b>This is what
///     batching removes.</b></item>
///   <item><c>ui</c> = wall − transport — deserialise + whatever the caller does
///     with each result. <b>Batching does NOT remove this.</b></item>
/// </list>
///
/// <para><b>Caveat the numbers carry.</b> Transport is summed per call, so with
/// two lanes sending concurrently the sum can exceed wall-clock. The heavy exports
/// this exists to measure are sequential, but a reader must not treat the sum as
/// exclusive time.</para>
///
/// Cost: one <see cref="Stopwatch.GetTimestamp"/> pair and two interlocked adds per
/// pipe call — negligible against a round-trip already measured in hundreds of
/// microseconds.
