"""Triage a UE game .exe for its engine version BEFORE spending a Ghidra import on it.

    py tools/pe/ue_version.py <exe> [<exe> ...]

Reads the compiled-in branch tag (`++UE4+Release-4.18` / `++UE5+Release-5.1`) out of the
binary, in both UTF-16LE and ASCII. When present that tag is authoritative — it is the engine
branch the binary was built from, unlike the PE ProductVersion, which some publishers leave at
a stale fallback (The Adventures of Elliot reports 4.27 and is really 5.4).

HIT RATE IS ABOUT HALF — measured 4 of 7 shipped games:

    Palworld     -> 5.1    Manor Lords -> 5.5
    Octopath     -> 4.18   Grimhook    -> 5.1
    Elliot / Titan Quest II / Solarpunk -> UNKNOWN (tag stripped)

So `UNKNOWN` means UNKNOWN, never "not interesting", and this is a filter rather than a gate.
The reliable version source stays the DLL's own runtime detection (`Genau::DetectVersion` —
see the `UE5_Init: Complete (UEnnn, ...)` line in the game's `init-0.log`), which reconciles
the PE data against what it finds in memory.

It still earns its place: it recovered Octopath Traveler as 4.18, which the sweep corpus had
carried as "4.x, version stripped" — corroborated structurally afterwards, since Octopath's
pattern fingerprint is identical to DQ XI S, a known 4.18 (GNames 7/28 hit, sparse 0/10).

A modular build (Satisfactory) reports a ~0 MB stub here: the engine lives in sibling
`*-Win64-Shipping.dll` modules, so point this at those instead.
