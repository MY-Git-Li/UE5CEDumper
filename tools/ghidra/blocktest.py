"""Pattern regression test over the shape blocks. Milliseconds, no Ghidra, no corpus, stdlib only.

THE GAP THIS FILLS. Between `extract_patterns.py` (which only checks for dead constants) and the
full sweep (which needs ~200 GB of Ghidra projects) there was NO test at all. So any edit to a
`Himmel.h` pattern was unverifiable on a machine without the corpus — which is every machine except
one. This runs anywhere, including CI.

WHAT IT ASSERTS, and it is the strong property: for each recorded site, the pattern that found it
must still match AND still RESOLVE to the same address. "The bytes still match" would pass even if
an edit broke the displacement arithmetic, which is exactly the class of bug that produced the
`GNAM_V7` out-of-bounds resolve.

    py tools/ghidra/blocktest.py                       # -> exit 0 / 1
    py tools/ghidra/blocktest.py --tsv <patterns.tsv>  # against a specific extraction
    py tools/ghidra/blocktest.py -v                    # list every check

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It cannot tell you a pattern is quiet (that is `tools/pe/aob_specificity.py`)
and it cannot tell you what the runtime would land on first — the priority walk needs whole images,
so `Himmel.h` rule 5 keeps meaning the sweep. A pattern can pass every block here and still take
thousands of hits on a real game.
