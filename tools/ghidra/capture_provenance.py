"""One-shot: snapshot the corpus's BUILD IDENTITY before build_corpus_manifest.py can null it.

Why this is not just a manifest re-run: the generator deliberately NULLS steam_buildid / size /
sha256 on any row whose on-disk bytes are no longer the corpus bytes (build_corpus_manifest.py
:360). That is right — it must never assert the wrong build — but it means the buildid pointing at
the SteamDB build a .rep was made from is DESTROYED the first time that game patches. Palworld
drifted on 2026-07-29, so its 24181527 was live-but-doomed.

Three identity sources, strongest first:
  1. sku.sis depot MANIFEST ids from X:\\SteamLibrary backup - EXACT, and they survive the game
     being uninstalled or even delisted (`steamcmd +download_depot <app> <depot> <manifest>`).
  2. steam_buildid - exact via SteamDB app -> Builds, but nulled on drift, hence this snapshot.
  3. file MTIME - the original Steam write time. It SURVIVES a copy (ctime does not), which is
     what makes install -> copy -> uninstall recoverable by date. Verified on this corpus:
     Hogwarts ctime 2026-07-29 but mtime 2025-12-04; Palworld mtime 2026-07-15 = the pre-patch
     build. Use file_modified, never file_created.

Output: tools/ghidra/corpus-provenance.tsv, a SNAPSHOT, never auto-regenerated.
